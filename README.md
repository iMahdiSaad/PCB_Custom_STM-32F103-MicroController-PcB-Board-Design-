## Usage

## Usage

The Custom STM32f103 Board is a versatile platform that can be used in various embedded systems and electronics projects. To get started with using the board, follow these general steps:

1. **Hardware Connection**: Connect the Custom STM32f103 Board to your computer or power source using the Micro USB interface. Ensure that you have the necessary power supply if USB power alone is insufficient for your application.

2. **Firmware Development**: Develop your custom firmware or application code using an integrated development environment (IDE) such as [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/). Write and compile your code, taking advantage of the STM32f103 microcontroller's features and peripherals.

3. **Programming**: Use a suitable programming tool or debugger (e.g., [ST-Link](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html)) to upload your firmware to the Custom STM32f103 Board. Ensure that the board is correctly configured for programming mode.

4. **Testing and Debugging**: Test your application on the board, monitoring its behavior and performance. Utilize the serial wire debug (SWD) support for real-time debugging and troubleshooting as needed.

5. **Customization**: Leverage the strapping pins to configure and customize the board's functionality to suit your specific project requirements. These pins can be used for various purposes, including setting different operating modes or connecting external components.

6. **Integration**: Incorporate the Custom STM32f103 Board into your project, connecting sensors, actuators, or other peripherals as necessary. Ensure that your hardware connections are secure and reliable.

7. **Documentation**: Document your project thoroughly, including circuit diagrams, pin mappings, and code explanations, to aid in future development and troubleshooting.

Remember that the exact usage and steps may vary depending on your specific project and application. Refer to the documentation provided with the STM32f103 microcontroller and the tools you are using for more detailed instructions.

Feel free to explore the STM32f103's capabilities, experiment with different configurations, and innovate in your embedded systems projects using the Custom STM32f103 Board as your development platform.
